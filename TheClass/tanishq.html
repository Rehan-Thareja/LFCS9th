               Tanishqa is a person whose mood and decisions can often shift unpredictably, displaying a fickle nature that can make interactions with his challenging at times. One moment, he might be highly engaged, and the next, completely disinterested, leaving others unsure of where he stands. This inconsistency in his behavior can make it difficult for those around his to form solid expectations or rely on his involvement in various situations. Tanishqa’s lack of commitment in certain areas adds to his reputation as a non-participant, someone who tends to avoid getting involved or taking responsibility when needed.
<br>
<br>
His belligerent side often comes into play when he feels challenged or provoked. Tanishqa can quickly escalate situations, becoming defensive or aggressive, showing a readiness to fight for his position, even in the most trivial of matters. This combative attitude, paired with his tendency to withdraw from participation, creates a paradox in his personality—one that can leave others feeling perplexed about his true intentions. Despite these traits, Tanishqa’s boldness and unpredictable nature make him an intriguing figure, though his actions often leave a lasting impression, whether positive or negative.
