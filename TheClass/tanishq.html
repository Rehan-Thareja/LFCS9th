               Tanishqa is a person whose mood and decisions can often shift unpredictably, displaying a fickle nature that can make interactions with her challenging at times. One moment, she might be highly engaged, and the next, completely disinterested, leaving others unsure of where she stands. This inconsistency in her behavior can make it difficult for those around her to form solid expectations or rely on her involvement in various situations. Tanishqaâ€™s lack of commitment in certain areas adds to her reputation as a non-participant, someone who tends to avoid getting involved or taking responsibility when needed.
<br>
<br>
Her belligerent side often comes into play when she feels challenged or provoked. Tanishqa can quickly escalate situations, becoming defensive or aggressive, showing a readiness to fight for her position, even in the most trivial of matters. This combative attitude, paired with her tendency to withdraw from participation, creates a paradox in her personalityâ€”one that can leave others feeling perplexed about her true intentions. Despite these traits, Tanishqaâ€™s boldness and unpredictable nature make her an intriguing figure, though her actions often leave a lasting impression, whether positive or negative.
